### About this project

This project contains a framework for students to quickly configure and evaluate access path selection strategies in DuckDB, a vectorized push-based columnar DBMS. 

This branch contains a sophisticated implementation of Column Sketches. To benchmark bitmap indexing and DuckDB's default zone maps, please switch to the BitmapIndexing branch. Although the two branches have not been merged, they share the same underlying codebase, so the comparison should be fair.

### Walk through the code

Please read the following code snippets to see how the framework operates.

- src/include/duckdb/storage/statistics/column_sketch.hpp contains the core Column Sketches implementation. Our implementation leverages AVX-512 acceleration and requires a modern Intel or AMD CPU with AVX-512 support.

- planner/filter/*_filter.cpp:CheckSketchStatistics() implements the logic for data skipping based on sketches of column data. Note that the neighboring CheckStatistics() function handles the equivalent logic for the native zone maps.

- storage/statistics/numeric_stats.cpp:CheckSketchTemplated() defines how column sketches are evaluated against specific predicates. E.g., "A = x" and  "A <= x".

### Run the code

First, compile the project.

```sh
make release (or debug)
```

Second, generate workloads and column sketches for columns involved in TPC-H Q6. This step takes a few minutes, (mainly) depending on your CPU HZ number.

```duckdb
set threads to 1;
call dbgen(sf=10);
```

Run the TPC-H Q6 using column sketches.

```duckdb
pragma tpch(6);
```

Note that the above `dbgen` command generates column sketches for columns involved in TPC-H Q6 automatically. If you want to building sketches for other query columns, you can update src/storage/local_storage.cpp:LocalStorage::Append().

Happy coding! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the TAs.
